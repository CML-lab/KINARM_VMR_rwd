This task implements a xlyophone where targets are displayed and a sound is made whenever a target is hit. The pitch of the sound can be modified for each target. This can be used for a bimanual or endpoint Kinarm.

Make sure to do the following before running the task in Dexterit-E, otherwise no sound will occur:

-run from the command line: java -jar toneplayer.jar
-double-click on TonePlayer.jar

(The first option is preferred as it is more controllable.)
